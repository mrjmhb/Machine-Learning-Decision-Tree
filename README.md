# Machine-Learning-Decision-Tree
Machine Learning Decision Tree Explained
Objectives
After completing this lab you will be able to:

Develop a classification model using Decision Tree Algorithm
In this lab exercise, you will learn a popular machine learning algorithm, Decision Trees. You will use this classification algorithm to build a model from the historical data of patients, and their response to different medications. Then you will use the trained decision tree to predict the class of an unknown patient, or to find a proper drug for a new patient.
